        Zen Computers is seller of personal computers. Teh staff works on a commission
        basis. At the end of each month, each sales person's commission is calculated according
        to the table listed below. The staff is also paid an advance amount Rs. 1000 every month.
        When the sales commission is calculated, the advance amount is subtracted from the
        commission. If any salesperson's commission is less than the amount, he or she
        must pay back the difference.

        Write a program in java to compute the commission at the end of each month.
